Hi, my name is Colin. I'm a software engineer born and raised in Upstate New York and currently living in Pittsburgh.

I fell in love with programming after getting my hands on a TI-83 graphing calculator in middle school, and it's been my full time job for the past 6 years. Before settling into that career path, I studied Mathematics, French, and Art History at Allegheny College and taught English in Normandy, France for a year in the TAPIF program. Upon returning to the US, I started working remotely as a fullstack engineer for a small web development shop called Brand New Ship.

In my time at Brand New Ship, I worked with over a dozen startups to build both features for existing websites and full sites from scratch. Most often the websites I built used Ruby on Rails back-ends with React front-ends, but I also worked with other technologies including Node, Wordpress, Angular, Shopify, and React Native.

Today, I'm building apps for the Shopify App Store and creating free open-source tools for other developers in the Shopify App ecosystem. 

Currently, I'm actively seeking new employment opportunities. If you're interested, please checkout out my [full resume](/resume.pdf).
