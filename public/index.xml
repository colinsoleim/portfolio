      <description>Hi, my name is Colin. I&#39;m a software engineer born and raised in Upstate New York and currently living in Pittsburgh.
I fell in love with programming after getting my hands on a TI-83 graphing calculator in middle school, and it&#39;s been my full time job for the past 6 years. Before settling into that career path, I studied Mathematics, French, and Art History at Allegheny College and taught English in Normandy, France for a year in the TAPIF program.</description>
