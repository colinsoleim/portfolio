      <description>Hi, my name is Colin. I&#39;m a software engineer born and raised in Upstate New York and currently living in Pittsburgh.
I fell in love with programming after getting my hands on a TI-83 graphing calculator at the age of 12, and it&#39;s been my full time job for the past 6 years. Before settling into that career path, I also studying Mathematics, French, and Art History in school. I received my Bachelor&#39;s from Allegheny College, and taught English in Normandy, France for a year before returning to the US to work remotely as a fullstack engineer for a small web development shop called Brand New Ship.</description>
